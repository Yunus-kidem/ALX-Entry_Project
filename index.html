                <h1>My story</h1>
                <p>I always craved to find my passion; as a result I try out many different things & use to read books etc… But when I stumbled upon web development, & software engineering in general; I was fascinated by how it aligned with my future goals
                    & having to build something from scratch and change an idea into a reality – that’s just astonishing.</p>
                <p>That being said, I found my passion for software engineering pretty late. I graduated with high school diploma from school of tomorrow, and then I was assigned at Mekelle university. The first semester was a common course, I had good grades
                    & chose engineering path. </p>
                <br>
                <h4> How I stubmled upon web development</h4>
                <p>During my stay there I had a friend who was a programmer, I saw him draw a layout & content on a paper; After 2 weeks I saw that exact drawing come to life. As I said it was so fascinating, so we arranged a time to study on 2nd semester
                    but before we choose our department Covid-19 outbreak & we were all sent home. </p>
                <p>I did some researching to be a self-taught developer & the path was so overwhelming. There are multiple language, tons of resources & without a clear path you easily lose track. So I decided it was better to learn it with him when campus
                    is re-opened after Covid-19. </p>
                <p>Even though we were called to come back, there was a conflict that started there & my family refused to let me go. I felt for a sec that my dream & goals that have huge impact vanished into thin air. After I took a deep breath, I realized
                    that I have to face the facts & that I will have to get through this overwhelming journey to find the right <a href="guide.html">path</a>.</p>
                <p>Then when I read about ALX I was so excited; the videos at the start of the application, there tough application process & post payment gave me a huge confidence on their organization. In our country payment method is the biggest roadblock
                    for things that require credit card. </p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>In the 21st century, digital technology is creating a fundamental shift in accelerating growth and development of the global economy. However, African countries are lagging behind from reaping the benefits of digitalization in boosting
                    productivity across sectors particularly its positive impact for opening job opportunities to the unemployed youth. Ethiopia having predominantly youth poulation(70%), is no exception to this reality. </p>
                <p>There are tons of problems waiting for us to be solved, that we can see in our day to day life, things you have to do</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we have to choose to notice them</li>
                    <li>Then, we need to acquire the set of skills required to solve those problems</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I personally chose the department of health & e-commerce. <strong>ALX will give me the required skills to save many people’s lives & also increase our economy </strong></p>
                <p>We’ve got to understand that the reason that you are existing in this world right now is because you have things that must be done and only certain people are qualified to take it to the next level that it needs to be taken to.</p>
                <p>“If you knew how quickly you are forgotten after you die” – that’s a huge motivation to push you to do great things & live life of impact. Keep in mind sooner or later we are all going to punch that clock, So do the best that you can to
                    have the right attitude to make your existence matter.</p>
                <p>After finalizing this course, I have also planned to contribute to my county’s effort to enhancing the role of the …..technology by establishing a multi sectoral tech-firm. The objectives of this …firm is two-fold: on the one hand to educate
                    significant number of the youth equipped with up to date skills in software engineering capable of providing creative solution to the challenges faced in all sectors of development thereby creating employment opportunities. On the
                    other hand, providing quality service to governmental and private sectors that aims to utilize unprecedented opportunities the digital technology offers in terms of enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of their sector.</p>
